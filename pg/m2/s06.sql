-- Kimberely is an employee
select employee_id, first_name, last_name

-- the inner join skips Kimberely
select first_name, last_name, name as department
from employee e inner join department d

where last_name like 'Gr%';

-- left outer join
select first_name, last_name, name
from employee left outer join department

-- rewritten as right outer join
select first_name, last_name, name
from department right outer join employee

-- "left" / "right" imply "outer"
select first_name, name
